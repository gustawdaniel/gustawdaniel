Tokenizers are a completely separate stage of the LLM pipeline: they have their own training sets, training algorithms (Byte Pair Encoding), and after training implement two fundamental functions: encode() from strings to tokens, and decode() back from tokens to strings. In this lecture we build from scratch the Tokenizer used in the GPT series from OpenAI. In the process, we will see that a lot of weird behaviors and problems of LLMs actually trace back to tokenization. We'll go through a number of these issues, discuss why tokenization is at fault, and why someone out there ideally finds a way to delete this stage entirely.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">If you was absent on previous you can watch all previous lessons.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Full curse is presented on page:<br>\n<a href=\"https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"!text-viridian\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html</a></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">---</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">✅ We will follow course program, discuss code, explain fragments that are unclear and learn together.<br>\n✅ After course there will be time to eat dinner making new connections in AI worlds and sharing what you think.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Basically you can just view video at your home, but learning in group you can grasp some ideas faster asking questions and learn deeper explaining something that you understand to others.</p></div></div>",

In my opinion language models are an excellent place to learn deep learning, even if your intention is to eventually go to other areas like computer vision because most of what you learn will be immediately transferable. This is why we dive into and focus on languade models.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Prerequisites: solid programming (Python), intro-level math (e.g. derivative, gaussian).</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">---</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This is <strong>first</strong> event from this series.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">This is the most step-by-step spelled-out explanation of backpropagation and training of neural networks. It only assumes basic knowledge of Python and a vague recollection of calculus from high school.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Full curse is presented on page:<br>\n<a href=\"https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"!text-viridian\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https://karpathy.ai/zero-to-hero.html</a></p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">---</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">✅ We will follow course program, discuss code, explain fragments that are unclear and learn together.<br>\n✅ After course there will be time to eat dinner making new connections in AI worlds and sharing what you think.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">Basically you can just view video at your home, but learning in group you can grasp some ideas faster asking questions and learn deeper explaining something that you understand to others.</p></div></div>",

It provides also ecosystem for models efficiency of llsm deployed on production apps.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">We will learn basics of LangChain by 3 examples.<br>\n- response structuring - on input we will put pdf invoice, and data model. We expect that out program will be able to get different PDF invoices and extract from them client, date, invoice number and total value for payment. This can be useful in digitization of data that are received in form like images of PDF.<br>\n- rag - in input we will put book and detailed question about details of one chapter, we will compare results from RAG that we created and Chat GPT. This can be used with any type of text, like documentation, or offer of our company.<br>\n- tools - as input we will give database and questions about data in human language.

This model can take an image as a background input and generate a video combined with prompt words, offering greater controllability. With this, the CogVideoX series models now support three tasks: text-to-video generation, video continuation, and image-to-video generation.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">So it is hot 🔥🔥 and fresh 🧊🧊.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-4\">If you didn't had any experience with AI, don't worry.
