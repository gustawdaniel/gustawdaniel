The fractional calculus is a extension of traditional calcus by noninteger orders of integrals and derivatives. Allows to generalize these operations and parametrize them to better understood how a functions that are these derivatives inject on each oder smoothly.

There you can see how behaves some fractional derivatives of known functions that I investigated.

### **How to calculate fractional derivatives and integrals**

Lets define differintegral operator - transformation that make differentiation for positive order and integration for negative. For integer $ \\alpha $ everything works like in traditional calculus.

```math
J^\alpha f = \begin{cases}
   D^\alpha f     & \text{if } x \gt 0 \\
   f              & \text{if } x = 0 \\
   I^{|\alpha|} f & \text{if } x < 0
  \end{cases}
```
