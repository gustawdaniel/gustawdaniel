In this blog post, we will explore the process of creating an RPM package for a Rust-based Command Line Interface (CLI) application on Fedora. The RPM package will allow users to easily install and manage the Rust CLI application on their Fedora systems.

Prerequisites:

1. A Rust CLI application you want to package
2. Fedora system for development and testing
3. Basic understanding of Rust and RPM package management

Steps to create an RPM package for a Rust CLI application:

Step 1: Install necessary tools

To create an RPM package, you will need to have the `rpm-build` and `cargo` packages installed on your Fedora system. Install them using the following command:

```
sudo dnf install rpm-build cargo
```
