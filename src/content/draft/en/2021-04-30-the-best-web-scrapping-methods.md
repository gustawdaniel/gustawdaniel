Before you start a conversation about the possibilities, technologies and methods of modern website hijackers, be sure to formulate your problem.

Problem formulation

Constant optimization of web resources for mobile devices, rising internet speeds, iron-level technology and program code, and designers searching the Worldwide web like you see it today. Namely - colorful, contrast, crowded and absolutely useless (sometimes harmful) information. These are different techniques and technologies in the implementation of websites and this is the main problem that must be solved when organizing data access.

Access to target content can be organized in two main directions:

By using the API when information owners provide it to users based on personal interest - subscriptions, shipping, partner programs, etc.

Without API use - Authority of the website by scraping (unless it is provided by their code).

The first direction is limited only by cash, and the consumer does not experience difficulties in technical implementation. The data obtained through the API is clearly organized and standardized. For example, in XML or JSON formats.

The second direction is web scraping- it deserves for attention and is a kind of “challenge” for developers and mathematicians. Automatic text processing using artificial intelligence, semantic analysis, etc. All this can be called a colossal technological breakthrough that requires development, awareness and proper evaluation.

Manual copy content

The easiest method of web scrapping is to manually search for the information you want, then copy and maintain the destination.

This method is suitable for small blogs or small shops with a small assortment of rhe same type of goods.

Benefits:

High-quality content and its final adaptation to the needs of the consumer.

High search speed.

Inconveniences:

A person's capabilities are significantly limited to physical resources, knowledge of the target ball, and trivial online search skills (not everyone can effectively use the search service tools).

A person is subject to various external influences (psychological, physical, etc.), and this adversely affects the stability of his work and the value of his services.

Detectable scraping up to several hundred qualitative results per day.

Regular expressions and capturing a match in the text

A very simple text processing technique and at the same time a powerful method of extracting information from the Internet. Especially in conjunction with the use of UNIX Capture commands (for example, "Curl"). Regular expressions are present in many programming languages ​​(for example, we implement web scraping with this method for several Python and Ruby projects).

The presented method is suitable for projects that involve automatic monitoring of several sources of information. Suppose scraping individual fragments (product name, its cost, phone numbers and e-mail addresses, etc.). In practice, implementing a scraper for one site can take about an hour. True only if target resource does not contain JS rendering traps.

Benefits:

If you already know the regular expressions of at least one programming language, the implementation of this decision will take the minimum amount of time.

Regular expressions allow you to quickly distinguish a large number of unnecessary small "fuzzy" from the result body, without breaking the main content (for example, clean up leftover HTML code).

Regular expressions are supported by almost all programming languages. And most importantly, their syntax from language to language hardly changes. This allows you to perform a painless migration of projects in languages ​​with greater efficiency and clarity of the Code (for example, from PHP to Ruby - recently such clients are becoming more and more).

Inconveniences:

Regular expressions can turn into a puzzle for those who haven't used them. In this case, it is better to contact specialists immediately. As a rule, problems arise when integrating solutions in one language into another or when migrating projects to another programming language.

Regular expressions are often very complex to read and parse. Sometimes, based on the specifics of the processed information, they are overstretched.

If the HTML has been changed on the target resource or a new tag has been added, most likely it will be changed and the regular expression (otherwise there is a high risk of "broken" content).

HTTP queries (HTML code analysis)

This method allows you to receive dynamic and static pages by sending HTTP requests to remote servers. It uses programming sockets and disassembles received responses from (if necessary) pre-prepared data on target containers (their classes and identifier).

The tool is suitable for most projects. In implementation it is slightly more compensated, but this is compensated by the possibility of obtaining large amounts of data quickly.

Benefits:

It allows you to get the original pages as HTTP responses.

Huge number of results limited only by server resources and Internet speed.

Inconveniences:

It requires processing of received responses - the results may contain many unnecessary ones.

Many sites are provided with protection against similar "robots" (as a production of the situation, you should generate additional site information in the header of the HTTP request, however not all sites can be fooled in this way).

A high probability is to be banned by the administrator of the destination or automated protection system when strange methodically repeating "interest" appears in the resource. Practice shows that the number and frequency of requests may exceed human capacity.

The remote server may be down or busy at the time the request is sent. As a result, there is a likelihood of a large number of limiting errors.

The collapse of the DOM structure based on screen effects

Dynamic content is one of the problematic moments of internet scraping. How to deal with this? To get it, you can use any full web weapon that recreates dynamic content and client-side script. Plugins are ready. They work for free and produce good results. True, with one reservation: poor performance. Only one result at a time. In fact, plugins like this solve a lot of problems and let you forget about things like cookies, regular expressions, http, etc.

Screen effects-based DOM structure analysis is suitable for large and medium-sized projects interested in both the amount of information extracted. The implementation of the automation of this method is quite complex from a technical point of view. However, our team managed to achieve the goal, and from design to design, it improves the developed functionality. To do this, a browser emulator has been written and supports a "virtual screen" with intelligent search for nodes in the DOM structure.

Benefits:

Get dynamic content.

Automation. It enables you to obtain high-quality content in large amounts.

The possibility of implementing commercial solutions. The method allows you to easily enjoy troubleshooting support for purchased / rented software.

Inconveniences:

The complexity and server loading during automation makes the process quite resource intensive, both in development and server costs.

Completeness of implementation. For non-specialists, it is virtually impossible, because it requires a thorough knowledge of "iron", the basics of web development and an excellent possession of at least one of the server programming languages.

Most of the implementation of this method is only applicable on a commercial basis, and the cost of such products has not yet tended to decrease.

Artificial intelligence and ontology methods

Imagine that you are faced with the task of scraping hundreds or thousands of sites. At the same time, they have a different layout and written in different languages ​​and frames. In such a situation, rational resources will invest in the development of complex artificial intelligence systems and / or ontologies (this method is based on the theory that all sites can be divided into classes and groups with a similar structure and set of technologies).

Benefits:

Having created a complex system, it allows you to get the highest possible content from a huge number of domains, even despite small changes to the pages (an intelligent system will adjust possible inaccuracies). The quality assessment for 150 thousand domains will be on average from 75% to 93% (verified by Jetrubia research in the implemented system).

The method enables the normalization of the result obtained from all sources in the database structure.

Despite the fact that such a system needs constant support (at the monitoring level), with possible failures, it requires little code intervention

Inconveniences:

Comprehensive implementation of the "engine", requiring a high level of knowledge in mathematics, statistics, and the sphere of fuzzy logic.

High development cost.

Similar costs of the support and training system.

Practice of subscribing to ready-made commercial projects. This applies to the limited number of requests and their high cost (we note that your own development pays off quickly).

You must provide bug trackers, data validity servers, and backup proxies destination site.

Similar costs of the support and training system. Practice of subscribing to ready-made commercial projects. This applies to the limited number of requests and their high cost (we note that your own development pays off quickly).
