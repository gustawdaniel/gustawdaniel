In your `~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf` add:

```bash
background_opacity         0.5
dynamic_background_opacity yes
```

but you do do not have configured picom running kitty you will see

```bash
[0.134] Failed to enable transparency. This happens when your desktop environment does not support compositing.
[0.158] [glfw error 65544]: process_desktop_settings: failed with error: [org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown] The name is not activatable
[0.158] [glfw error 65544]: Notify: Failed to get server capabilities error: [org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown] The name is not activatable
```

So you need to install picom:

```bash
yay -S picom
```

and add to your `~/.config/picom/picom.conf`:

```
mkdir -p ~/.config/picom
echo 'backend = "glx";' > ~/.config/picom/picom.conf
```

now calling picom

```
picom --config ~/.config/picom/picom.conf
```

you should see transparency in new kitty windows that you opening now.

If you have problems with `glx` backend you can try `xrender` or `glx-legacy`:

Picom supports several backends that you can use for rendering. The main backends available in Picom are:

- `glx`: This backend uses OpenGL for rendering, which can provide better performance and visual effects. It's recommended for systems with good OpenGL support, especially when using hardware acceleration.
- `xrender`: This is a more widely compatible backend that uses the X Render Extension. It's typically a good choice for systems that may not support OpenGL. However, it may not provide the same level of visual effects (like shadows and transparency) as glx.
- `glx-legacy`: This is a variant of the glx backend and can be used for systems with older hardware that may not support newer OpenGL features. Itâ€™s less commonly used.

If you want to start picom with i3 you can add to your `~/.config/i3/config`:

```bash
exec_always --no-startup-id picom --config ~/.config/picom/picom.conf -b
```
