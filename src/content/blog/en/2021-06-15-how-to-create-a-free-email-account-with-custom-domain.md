## Yandex: The Last Free Custom Email Provider

After both Google and Microsoft restricted custom email creation to paid plans, Yandex Mail has become one of the few remaining providers that offers free custom email options.

First, go to [https://mail.yandex.com/](https://mail.yandex.com/) and create a new Yandex account to serve as your organization-wide admin account.

You can choose to verify your account with a phone number or a security question.

Log in to your new account at [https://mail.yandex.com/](https://mail.yandex.com/) then go to [https://connect.yandex.com/portal/services/webmaster](https://connect.yandex.com/portal/services/webmaster).

## Adding a new domain

Choose the DNS option and add a TXT record in your domain provider's DNS settings to verify your domain.

It should look similar to this example.

## AdCreating User Accounts and Custom Email Prefixes

To create a new email account, go to [https://connect.yandex.com/portal/admin/users/](https://connect.yandex.com/portal/admin/users/)

Then click **Все сотрудники** (All employees), and add a new user by selecting "Add" and choosing "Add a person." You can also set up mailing lists by "Creating a department" and adding people to it.

Congratulations! You’ve just set up a custom email for free!

If you want to create another email under the same domain later, you can do so, but only from the admin account \_\_\_@yandex.com that you created initially, as it remains the sole admin account for your organization.

If you know about other great Yandex features, share them in the comments :)
